ABOUT / SUMMARY
============================================================

(Maximum 2600 characters - tell your story)

I build reliable end-to-end data systems that turn messy data into trusted decisions and clear insights. As both a Data Engineer and Data Scientist, I bridge the gap between robust infrastructure and actionable analytics, ensuring data flows seamlessly from raw ingestion to production-ready insights.

My work combines two complementary disciplines. As a **Data Engineer**, I design and build scalable batch and real-time pipelines using Python, Spark, Airflow, Kafka, dbt, and Postgres. I implement platform infrastructure, medallion architectures (Bronze/Silver/Gold), and streaming systems that are reproducible, well-tested, and production-ready. As a **Data Scientist**, I focus on practical, explainable solutions—demand forecasting, fraud detection, analytics engineering, and business intelligence—using Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Power BI.

**What I Bring to Teams:**

• **End-to-End Thinking**: From raw data ingestion to validated Gold tables to BI dashboards and ML model training, I ensure every step is testable, documented, and production-ready.

• **Data Quality Mindset**: I build guardrails for freshness, schema validation, and accuracy at every layer, reducing pipeline failures and detecting issues early.

• **Reproducible Systems**: Idempotent jobs, clear contracts, automated tests, version control, and comprehensive documentation for faster handoffs and team onboarding.

• **Stakeholder Communication**: I translate complex data concepts into clear, simple explanations for non-technical teams, backed by transparent documentation and well-designed visualizations.

**Technical Expertise:**

→ **Data Engineering**: Spark, Airflow, Kafka, Flink, dbt, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, ETL/ELT pipelines
→ **Data Science**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, statistical modeling, forecasting, explainable ML
→ **Databases**: PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, SQL Server
→ **Analytics & Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, analytics engineering, semantic layers
→ **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Terraform, Git, CI/CD

**Portfolio Highlights:**

My portfolio showcases six production-ready projects that demonstrate both data engineering and data science capabilities:

→ **Platform Design**: Reproducible local data infrastructure with Docker Compose, Airflow, Kubernetes, and Terraform
→ **Batch Medallion Pipeline**: Bronze/Silver/Gold architecture with Spark, dbt, and Airflow orchestration
→ **Real-Time Streaming**: Kafka and Flink pipeline for continuous event processing with real-time analytics
→ **Demand Forecasting**: Retail analytics pipeline combining data engineering and machine learning for actionable revenue insights
→ **Fraud Detection**: Streaming fraud monitoring with rolling features, Spark Structured Streaming, and nightly ML retraining
→ **Analytics Engineering**: Clean semantic layer with dbt, demonstrating layered models, tests, and documentation

Each project includes Docker Compose demos, architectural diagrams, clear READMEs, and working code that can be run locally.

**What Drives Me:**

I'm passionate about helping teams reduce pipeline failures, ship metrics with confidence, and turn data into decisions that stakeholders can trust. If you're looking for someone who can translate requirements into clean pipelines, transparent models, strong documentation, and working demos—let's connect.

**Open to**: Data Engineering roles, Data Science roles, Analytics Engineering opportunities, and hybrid positions that leverage both skill sets.
